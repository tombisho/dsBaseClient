\usage{
ds.lmerSLMA(formula = NULL, offset = NULL, weights = NULL,
  combine.with.metafor = TRUE, dataName = NULL, checks = FALSE,
  datasources = NULL, REML = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{formula}{Denotes an object of class formula which is a character string which describes
the model to be fitted. Most shortcut notation allowed by Rlme4's lmer() function is
also allowed by ds.lmerSLMA. Many lmes can be fitted very simply using a formula like:
"y~a+b+(1|c)" which simply means fit a lme with y as the outcome variable with a and b as fixed effects, and c
as a random effect or grouping factor. This allows for a random intercept between groups.
By default all such models also include an intercept (regression constant) term.
It is also possible to fit models with random slopes by specifying a model such as "y~a+b+(1+b|c)"}

\item{offset}{A character string specifying the name of a variable to be used as
an offset (effectively
a component of the linear predictor of the lme which has a known coefficient a-priori and so does not need to be
estimated by the model).}

\item{weights}{A character string specifying the name of a variable containing
prior regression
weights for the fitting process.}

\item{combine.with.metafor}{This argument is Boolean. If TRUE (the default) the
estimates and standard errors for each regression coefficient are pooled across
studies using random effects meta-analysis under maximum likelihood (ML),
restricted maximum likelihood (REML), or fixed effects meta-analysis (FE).}

\item{dataName}{A character string specifying the name of an (optional) dataframe that contains
all of the variables in the lme formula. This avoids you having to specify the name of the
dataframe in front of each covariate in the formula e.g. if the dataframe is
called 'DataFrame' you
avoid having to write: "DataFrame$y~DataFrame$a+DataFrame$b+(1|DataFrame$c)"
Processing stops if a non existing data frame is indicated.}

\item{datasources}{a list of \code{\link{DSConnection-class}} objects obtained after login. If the <datasources>
the default set of connections will be used: see \link{datashield.connections_default}.}

\item{REML}{A boolean indicating whether REstricted Maximum Likelihood (REML) should be used for
the parameter estimation criterion. This is useful for likelihood ratio tests when assessing the quality of the
fixed effects portion of the model. The idea is to compare the models with and without the fixed effects to see
if they are significantly different (e.g. using ANOVA). REML assumes that fixed effects structure is correct and
so for this type of comparison, it should not be used.}

\value{
many of the elements of the output list returned by ds.lmerSLMA from
each study separately are
equivalent to those from lmer() in lme4 with potentially disclosive elements
such as individual-level residuals and linear predictors blocked.
The return results from each study appear first in the return list with one
block of results from each study in the order they appear in datasources.
As regards the elements within each study the most important
elements are included last in the return list because they then appear at the
bottom of a simple print out of the return object. In reverse order, these
key elements in reverse order are:

coefficients:- a matrix in which the first column contains the names of
all of the regression parameters (coefficients) in the model, the second column
contains the estimated values, the third their corresponding standard errors,
the fourth the ratio of estimate/standard error and the fifth the p-value
treating that as a standardised normal deviate
#' @return CorrMatrix:- the correlation matrix of parameter estimates

VarCovMatrix:- the variance covariance matrix of parameter estimates

weights:- the vector (if any) holding regression weights

offset:- the vector (if any) holding an offset (enters glm with a coefficient of 1.0)

cov.scaled:- equivalent to VarCovMatrix

Nmissing:- the number of missing observations in the given study

Nvalid:- the number of valid (non-missing) observations in the given study

Ntotal:- the total number of observations in the given study (Nvalid+Nmissing)

data:- - equivalent to input parameter dataName (above)

call:- - summary of key elements of the call to fit the model

there are a small number of more esoteric items of information returned
by ds.lmerSLMA. Additional information about these can be found in the help
file for the lmer() function in the lme4 package.

input.beta.matrix.for.SLMA:- a matrix containing the vector of coefficient
estimates from each study. In combination with the corresponding standard errors
(see input.se.matrix.for.SLMA) these can be imported directly into a study level
meta-analysis (SLMA) package such as metafor to generate estimates pooled via SLMA

input.se.matrix.for.SLMA:- a matrix containing the vector of standard error
estimates for coefficients from each study. In combination with the coefficients
(see input.beta.matrix.for.SLMA) these can be imported directly into a study level
meta-analysis (SLMA) package such as metafor to generate estimates pooled via SLMA

SLMA.pooled.estimates:- a matrix containing pooled estimates for each
regression coefficient across all studies with pooling under SLMA via
random effects meta-analysis under maximum likelihood (ML), restricted maximum
likelihood (REML) or via fixed effects meta-analysis (FE)

\details{
Fits a linear mixed effects model (lme) on data from a single source or from multiple sources.
In the latter case, the lme is fitted to convergence in each data source and the
estimates and standard errors
returned from each study separately. When these are then pooled using a function such as
ds.metafor, this is a form of study level meta-analysis (SLMA). The SLMA approach offers some advantages
 when there is marked heterogeneity
between sources that cannot simply be corrected with fixed effects each reflecting a study
or centre effect. In particular fixed effects cannot simply be used in this way when there
there is heterogeneity in the effect of scientific interest.
